## About this Project
A Front-end job totally done in flutter, a copy of the layout of a bank app, with some changes, like color and border radius.

## The idea of the App is:
Train my reproduction of layouts using the flutter, and State Management with Mobx and MaskTextInputFormatter.

## Why?
With the need to reproduce screens, sometimes we encounter problems and doubts along the way, the goal is to learn how to get around these problems and thus solve my own doubts.
